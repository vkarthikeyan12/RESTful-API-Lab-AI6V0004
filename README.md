# RESTful API Lab  
**Course Code:** AI6V0004  

## Lab Overview
This repository contains a series of 10 hands-on experiments for learning and practicing **RESTful API development**. The lab exercises cover the fundamentals of REST architecture, CRUD operations, API security, error handling, database integration, testing, and deployment.  

Students will use **Python Flask** to build APIs and use **cURL** to test them.

## Experiments

1. **Introduction to REST and HTTP Methods**  
   - Understand the REST architecture and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  

2. **Building a Simple REST API**  
   - Create API endpoints that return JSON data.  

3. **Using URL Parameters and Query Strings**  
   - Learn how to extract path and query parameters for dynamic responses.  

4. **Performing CRUD Operations**  
   - Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality using API endpoints.  

5. **REST API with File-Based Storage**  
   - Persist data in a JSON file to simulate database storage.  

6. **REST API with Database Integration**  
   - Connect APIs to a database (SQLite or MongoDB) and perform CRUD operations.  

7. **Authentication using API Keys**  
   - Secure API endpoints using API key-based authentication.  

8. **Error Handling and Status Codes**  
   - Implement structured error handling with proper HTTP status codes.  

9. **Testing APIs using Postman Collection**  
   - Automate API testing and validate responses using Postman.  

10. **Deploying a REST API**  
    - Host APIs on localhost

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RESTful-API-Lab-AI6V0004.git
cd RESTful-API-Lab-AI6V0004
```

### Running the API
```bash
python app.py
The API will run on http://localhost:5000/.
```

### Testing the API
```
Use cURL commands provided in each experiment folder to test API endpoints.
```

### Notes
Each experiment is self-contained and can be run independently.

Follow proper JSON formatting while sending data in POST/PUT requests.

Make sure to install all dependencies before running the API.
